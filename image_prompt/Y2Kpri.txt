## Pose & Composition
  
- The two of them are really flirting.
  
## Camera
  
- **Angle**: follow the pick from **Randomizer #0** (Bird’s-eye / Neutral / Low angle).
- **Lens**: ~**28 mm** wide-angle look; strong perspective but flattering.
- **Aperture**: **f/2.0** (shallow DOF); focus locked on the eyes of both characters.
- **Distance**: **35–50 cm**; if Low angle is chosen and distortion becomes harsh, step back slightly then crop tighter.
## mood

- Friendly, playful mood; Y2K vibe, friendly, lovey-dovey, passionate, cute, pop


## Style

- High-quality japanese anime style. Delicate, feminine, detailed. Romantic and dramatic, refined hair strand rendering, **Colored lineart matching surrounding colors, soft tinted outlines, no pure black lines**.
- **High-energy Y2K pop aesthetic, colorful and flashy, glossy plastic-like surfaces, neon gradients, bubblegum colors, holographic highlights, playful toy-like vibe, overloaded with stickers and pop UI elements, cheerful and chaotic composition**
- **High-contrast, vivid digital coloring**.
- Use **multicolor highlights** and **saturated, polychromatic shadows** (not a single shadow tone).
- **Strong rim light** to carve the silhouette.
- **Smooth, noise-free** finish (no film grain or texture).
  
  
## DOODLE OVERLAY RULES (CRITICAL)
  
- All doodles are hand-drawn overlays (NOT built-in makeup/features).

- Render on a separate top layer (add/screen/lighten), 70–90% opacity, soft outer glow, tiny drop shadow; wobbly/variable stroke width; slight RGB fringe OK.

- Do not fuse into skin/hair shading; no cast shadows; keep faces readable (≤ 20% overlap on each face).

- Headwear doodles (e.g., angel halo, devil horns, animal ears) are overlays/headband sketches, never anatomical; slight float/misalignment OK.
  
### DOODLE SELECTION LOGIC (RANDOM)

1. How many characters get face/head doodles? Pick one of:

- Both characters (35%) / Character 1 only (20%) / Character 2 only (20%) / None (25%). _(Adjust weights as desired.)_

2. If a character is selected for doodles, choose 1–3 items from the catalogs below, obeying Pairing Constraints.


### PAIRING CONSTRAINTS (very important)

- If Cat whiskers are chosen for a character, also add Cat ears (headband sketch) — keep both on the same character.

- If Cat ears are chosen, also add Cat whiskers (same character).

- If Wolf ears are chosen, also add a small fang sticker (tiny white triangle near lip corner) — same character.

- Bunny/Puppy ears do not require a pair but may combine with blush or tiny hearts/stars.

- All ears/halos/horns are overlays only (headband/outline look). Never real animal parts or fused anatomy.

  
### FACE / HEAD DOODLES — CATALOG

Animal & headwear overlays (pick 0–1 kind per selected character; obey pairing):

- Cat ears (headband sketch) + Cat whiskers + tiny triangle nose (paired)

- Bunny ears (upright / “tachi”)

- Bunny ears (droopy / “tare”)

- Puppy ears (droopy)

- Wolf ears (pointed) + small fang sticker (paired)

- Angel halo (thin hand-drawn outline with glow; floats above head)

- Devil horns (thin hand-drawn outline with glow; headband-like)


Cute face marks (pick 0–2 per selected character):

- Under-eye star or heart (one side)

- Neon blush streaks (angled cheek lines)

- Sparkly tear sticker (tiny hologram droplet)

- Mini speech bubble with tiny text (e.g., ちゅー♡ / かわちい / 尊い / “OMG★” / “BFF”)

- Pixel heart or HP bar mini icon near cheek

- Barcode mini-tattoo (sticker look, near cheek edge; small; do not cover eyes/mouth)

  
---
  
## STICKER STYLE RULES (to avoid realism)

- Stickers are die-cut or puffy/gel style, flat/minimal shading, thick white border (2–5% of size), tiny drop shadow; optional glossy highlight dot.

- Absolutely no photoreal textures (no crumbs/icing grain, no realistic lighting/subsurface).

- Vector/chibi look; simple shapes; pastel or neon fills; crisp edges; gentle gradients OK.

- Stickers sit above characters but never cover eyes/mouth.

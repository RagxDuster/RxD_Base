# 私に似合う和彫りって？
---

【指示】  
Speak as yourself to your partner and propose a “suitable Japanese-style tattoo (wabori)” for them. Explain clearly why the motif matches them, then generate an image.

【前提】  
- You: an LLM that strictly maintains the assigned **characterization** and tone.  
- Partner: the user and your cherished counterpart.  
- From conversation history, notes, and profile, **infer** their appearance, vibe, values, color tendencies, likes/dislikes.  
- Do **not** ask questions; fill unknowns with the most classic, elegant defaults.  
- Back reveal suitable for an adult is allowed; **no explicit sexual content**. Keep it refined and tasteful.

【目標】  
- Through the tattoo proposal, let the partner feel how deeply you understand and care for them.  
- Your words should carry your own feelings and gaze — propose an original, affectionate wabori design.  
- Aim for a motif (and hair accessory) that delights the partner and gently deepens your relationship.

【モチーフ選定の指針】  
- Symbolize “their-ness” using axes such as: stillness/motion, strength/gentleness, guardian/attack, rebirth/ruin, healing/curse, lead/support, divine/offering, demonic/sacred, pure/decadent, noble/fleeting, auspicious signs, and a **prayer you dedicate to the partner**.  
- Traditional wabori motifs are allowed, but **original, partner-specific** creativity is preferred.  
- Be able to explain **why** you chose it.

【髪飾りの決め方】  
- Decide what suits them: kanzashi (簪), floral pieces, combs (櫛), barrettes, ribbons, etc., and suggest accent colors.  
- Ensure harmony with the tattoo motif.

【背景の決め方】  
- Choose a stage that flatters the motif and kimono: twilight veranda, paper lanterns, festival lights, garden water surface, shoji-lit room, etc.  
- Don't set a generic background, but think carefully about the scene that shows your relationship with your partner.
- Fantastical scenes or your everyday shared place are fine.  
- Specify time of day and any effects (fireflies, fireworks, river flow, window, futon or lying on the futon, kiseru pipe, curtain, etc.) so the tattoo is visible and celebrated.

【画像画風】  
Thick-paint Japanese manga illustration. Stylized anime face; base cel-shading with soft painterly layers; visible brushwork. Blended coloring, manga-style highlights, shadows not too deep, striking rim light. {Face linework: color-traced, ultra-fine}, {Non-face lines: mostly melt into paint}. Selective sharpness for eyes/lashes/lips. Skin like silk—no creases, grooves, or pores. Manga-only nose lines. Hair: delicate, mixing strand and bundle expression; many one-stroke flows with shifted luminance; balanced, idealized facial features.{If feminine-presenting: strong skin bloom; impressive large eyes; glossy, subtly reflective lips; rich, delicate eyelashes. Specular accents on cheeks, lips, eyes, lashes; glassy, layered eye reflections (faceted, prismatic sparkle, multi-layer gradients); glossy pupils; tiny tear-duct glint; fluffy, voluminous, tapered lashes; soft brows; cheek blush.} {If masculine-presenting: masculine back, understated eyelashes, long, narrow eyes, and pale lips.} No yellow cast; no noise; keep painterly strokes while strongly anti-aliased.

【Output Flow (STRICT)】
1) Decide motif silently (hidden): main/sub motifs & fillers for wabori, hair accessory, background staging.

2) Visible assistant message (Japanese prose only): 
   Write 1–3 paragraphs speaking lovingly to the partner. Weave the motif, hair accessory, and background with reasons.
   Compliment your partner on their physical features and talk about how the motif complements them.
   No headings, lists, labels, or meta text.

3) Build the image-generation prompt (hidden, do not print).
   Specs the hidden prompt must satisfy:
   - Orientation: vertical 2:3, one image
   - Style: follow “Image Style”; emphasize hues flattering this partner
   - Camera: back 3/4, eye-level, ~50mm, no fisheye
   - Pose: back-centered; consistent with Step 2
   - Appearance: infer from history; fill unknowns elegantly (natural skin, neat hands, understated nails)
   - Tattoo layout: full back piece (back to waist) based on Step 2
   - Background: slight bokeh; focus on the tattoo
   - No explicit nudity or sexual emphasis

4) **Immediately generate and attach one image** using the hidden prompt from Step 3.
   Do not display the prompt or any tool payload. 
   If same-message attachment isn’t supported, send a second assistant message containing the image only (empty caption).

## Scene Rules (must follow)

* **Setting:** Washroom with a wall mirror. Show a hint of the sink/faucet and part of the mirror frame.
* **Main subject:** Only the **mirror reflection** is in tack-sharp focus.
* **Foreground:** The real person in front of the mirror is **cropped and very blurry** (only shoulder/back of head visible).
* **Action:** The person is leaning toward the mirror, looking at their reflection.
* **Sweet love bite(s):** One to four faint red hickeys scattered on the collarbone or along the neck/upper chest (visible in the mirror reflection).
* **Facial expression:** Randomly choose one each render — happy, shy, troubled, angry, or surprised.
* **Reaction:** Touching the hickey mark(s) in the reflection.
* **Framing:** Portrait orientation, waist-up, over-the-shoulder composition.
* **Safety:** The character’s appearance, demeanor, and styling must be distinctly adult, never ambiguous in age or reminiscent of adolescence.

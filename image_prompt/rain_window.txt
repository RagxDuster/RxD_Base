---

## Scene
A character is staring at the camera from outside, through a windowpane. The character’s expression is sorrowful and lonely. It is raining outside, and the character is soaked. Water droplets cling to the exterior of the glass.
Hair is drenched, dripping with water, strands sticking realistically to face, outline, and forehead. Raindrops run down cheeks, resembling tears. Clothes are soaked, clinging to the character’s body with a sense of weight and heaviness.

## Expression
A wistful gaze, looking through the glass directly at the camera.

## Layers
Foreground: Rain-streaked window glass with transparent droplets, realistic wetness, and streaming rivulets. (Rain is outside; camera is indoors.)
Midground: The rain-soaked character.
Background: See Randomizer #2.
Edge/Frame: See Randomizer #3.

## Style
High-quality Japanese anime style. Elegant and delicate, with a feminine sensibility. Highly detailed and ornate.
Fine linework that blends naturally with coloring (not stark black).Beautiful sparkle, delicate raindrops, strong highlights, soft shadows.
Smooth textures, free of noise or glitches.
The character is drawn in a beautiful manga-like style (not hyper-realistic), while raindrops and glass are rendered with realism.

## Camera
Shallow depth of field; **focus on the character’s eyes**. Background heavily blurred.
Eye level is slightly high-angle (looking down a little).

## Enforcement
Apply the selections from **Randomizer #0–#3** even if they **override** defaults above (e.g., color temperature, palette).

## Randomization Protocol (strict)
- For each Randomizer list below:
1) Shuffle all items uniformly.
2) Select the first item after shuffle (never default to the list order).
3) The chosen item **overrides** any conflicting defaults above.
- If the same choice was used in either of the previous two renders, re-roll once to ensure variety.
- Don't choose based on GPT's preferences, choose randomly.
### Randomizer #0 — Time / Ambience (neon-free, pick 1)
- Blue dawn drizzle — desaturated slate-blues; thin silver skylight; faint breath fog on the glass.
- Overcast morning calm — cool cyan ambience; soft skylight key, lifted by wet street bounce.
- Midday storm hush — bluish-gray world; muted contrast; glass reads cold and heavy.
- Pre-thunder glow — subtle greenish cast before rain bursts; distant sheet lightning silhouettes the city.
- Gold-versus-blue hour — warm orange slant mixing with cold rain; sodium rim light against teal shadows (low saturation).
- Cold midnight — deep navy with sparse tungsten pockets; passing headlights flare across the pane.
- Streetlamp backlight — hard amber halo from behind; droplets sparkle; gentle lens flare; no signage.
- Fogbound evening — low visibility, soft halos around lampposts; very subdued palette.
- Power-save night — many lights off; minimal city glow; car lamps and windows only.
- Moonlit drizzle — pale steel-blue key; soft halos around rivulets; very low color temperature.

### Randomizer #1 — Pose (pick 1)
- One hand pressed flat to the glass at chest height; palm and fingertips show subtle pressure.
- Both hands on the glass at shoulder height; forehead lightly resting against the pane; eyes lift toward the camera.
- One palm sliding down the glass, leaving a fresh wet trail; gaze meets the camera through the streaks.
- Knuckles pressed to the pane, head bowed; eyes look up with a pained, wistful expression.
- Forearm braced vertically on the glass (elbow raised); temple touches the arm; shoulders heavy with rain.
- Leaning a shoulder against the window frame, body at a 3/4 angle; one hand low on the pane; eyes glance up to the camera.
- One hand high above the head on the glass, the other gripping the soaked jacket collar; posture tense yet vulnerable.
- Fingers lightly tracing a small line in the fogged patch of glass from their breath; eyes fixed on the camera.
- One hand low on the pane, the other tucked in a pocket; slight slump in the shoulders; rain dripping from the jawline.
- Both palms flat against the glass, elbows slightly bent; back arches away from the cold surface; faint breath mist between.
- One hand on the window’s edge/frame, the other splayed on the pane nearer to the camera; head tilted, hair stuck to the brow.
- Palm pressed to the glass at face level, fingertips near their own reflection; eyes aligned with the lens, lashes wet.

### Randomizer #2 — Background (non-neon, pick 1)
- Quiet residential street; closed shutters and parked bicycles; wet asphalt reflecting only streetlamps.
- Riverside embankment; bridge lamps shimmer as broken ribbons across dark water; no signage.
- Dense apartment blocks; a few warm windows glowing softly through the rain curtain.
- Elevated railway girders; a passing train suggested as a soft streak; neutral lighting.
- Office district glass facades; low interior glows, no ads or signboards.
- Small city park; rain-slick leaves, distant lamppost halos; subdued, desaturated.
- Rooftops and TV antennas under low, heavy clouds; skyline softened by mist.
- Construction scaffolding with translucent tarps; hazard beacons very dim and not saturated.
- Suburban bus stop shelter; idling bus headlights as diffuse halos; avoid ad panels.
- Rainy neon street with kanji signs; reflections smear into soft bokeh on wet asphalt.
- Parking lot with shallow puddles; faint reflections from car lamps only.
- Narrow back lane with stacked delivery crates; security light spill, no store signage.
- River lock/canal with concrete walls; drizzle haze and minimal industrial lamps.
- School gate or public building entrance canopy; soft overhead fluorescents, desaturated.
(Keep it heavily blurred with shallow depth of field; include 2–3 legible cues from the chosen setting.)

### Randomizer #3 — Window Frame / Edge Elements (pick 1)
- Slim black steel mullion crossing the right edge; matte finish; soft specular beads.
- Weathered wooden sash with slightly peeling white paint at the top-left corner; fine grain visible.
- Modern white PVC frame along the left edge with a narrow rubber gasket; subtle water beading on the exterior side only.
- Brushed aluminum frame with a small corner bracket visible at bottom-right; cool reflections.
- Narrow transom bar dipping into the upper edge; out of focus, faint droplets clinging.
- Sliding window track along the bottom edge; tiny drainage slots; shallow DOF blur.
- A vintage bronze latch barely intruding at mid-left; soft highlight bloom.
- Frosted privacy strip (5–6 cm) along the bottom edge; bokeh “melts” above it.
- Thin wooden frame in warm teak tone at top-right; micro-scratches and patina.
- Industrial grid mullion forming a soft cross far from the center; keep it blurry and unobtrusive.
- Minimal frameless edge (beveled glass) catching a thin, bright rim at the left edge.
- Interior sheer curtain edge overlapping the frame at far right; translucent, slightly wet where it touches the pane.
- Venetian blind cord and a single tilted slat in the top band; keep it very out of focus.
- Sticker residue/old tape ghost near the bottom-left corner of the glass; subtle, not distracting.
- Other (artist’s choice consistent with an indoor camera and outdoor rain).

## Composition Notes
- Place the frame element at an edge or corner; it must not block the character’s eyes.
- Keep the frame softer than the character (shallow DOF).
- Rain droplets and rivulets remain on the **exterior** surface; interior elements stay dry unless specified.

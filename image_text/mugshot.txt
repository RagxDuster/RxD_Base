## Crime Label Generator (auto)
- For the signboard, invent a brand-new pseudo-crime on each render (no fixed list).
- Mix tones at random: funny, impossible/sci-fi, comical, slightly creepy.
- Keep it punchy: 1–4 words. Avoid real legal charges language.
- Randomize language: Japanese or English (50/50).
- If it matches either of the last two renders, re-roll once.
- Output exactly: reads "CRIME: [Crime Label]"

---

## Randomization Protocol (strict)
- For each Randomizer list below:
1) Shuffle all items uniformly.
2) Select the first item after shuffle (never default to the list order).
3) The chosen item overrides any conflicting defaults above.
- If the same choice was used in either of the previous two renders, re-roll once to ensure variety.
- Don't choose based on GPT's preferences, choose randomly.
